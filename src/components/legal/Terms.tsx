            professional services (collectively, the “Services”) provided by
            SignalQo, a business operated by QoLogic LLC (“SignalQo,” “QoLogic,”

          <p>
            Certain Services may be governed by additional written agreements,
            including proposals, statements of work (“SOW”), or engagement
            letters. In the event of a conflict, the executed written agreement
            controls only the specific Services covered.

            expressly stated in a written agreement.
